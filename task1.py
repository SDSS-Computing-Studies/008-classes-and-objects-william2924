It should have the following properties
str name
str studentNumber
int grade
list courses - to corresepond with course names
list grades - to correspond with grades

It should have the following methods:
average()       - determines the mathematical average of all course grades
getHonorRoll()  - determines the average of the top 5 courses if there are at least 5 courses.
                  returns True if the average is 86 or higher (on the honor roll)
                  returns False if not on the honor roll
showCourses()   - prints a list of all courses
showGrade(int)  - takes 1 parameter, the index of the list
                - displays the course name and grade
getCourses(list)- Receives a list of courses and stores that in the class property
getGrades(list) - Receives a list of grades and stores that in the class property
constructor     - should require the student name, studentNumber and grade (in that order)
